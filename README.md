# phd_thesis_noverlty_impact_indicator

## General

This is a repositoty for my phd thesis (Chapter3), incoporating semantic uniqueness weight for any type of newness in each patents based on the Semantic/Usage Change Detection algorithm (refer to https://github.com/allen-zqh/semantic_change_detection). I use Sam Arts (2021)' work (refer to https://github.com/sam-arts/respol_patents_code) as the baseline and propose two types of new indicators: 1) refined indicators by semantic uniqueness 2) newly designed Pantent Novelty (PN) and Patent Impact (PI) indicators.

I will opensource the data & code for this part and relevant results for replication when this paper is sent for peer-review or so.
